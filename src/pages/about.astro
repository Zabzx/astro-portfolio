            <p class="mt-12 sm:w-2/3 text-md font-raleway text-white sm:leading-9">I started self learning web development when I was 19 during the beginning of the Covid-19 lockdown. I began reading a book called “Head first HTML and CSS” After this, my main source of learning were online courses and building various different projects to get a feel for HTML CSS and JavaScript. I started liking the feeling of accomplishment after solving a hard problem and that’s when I started taking it seriously. I learned ReactJS and TailwindCSS and really enjoyed it.f Every day I kept enhancing my skills and improving as a Front End developer. My next journey is to learn backend development and become a Full Stack Engineer, learn and use new languages and frame works, and overall be a developer that people and my team can rely on to get  the job done.</p>

            <p class="mt-10 font-raleway sm:w-2/3 text-white">Extra: I love watching and playing football (European), competitive video games, and working out 😁</p>
